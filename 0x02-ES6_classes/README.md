## Introduction

This repository provides an in-depth look at ES6 classes and metaprogramming in JavaScript. It includes examples and explanations to help you understand how to use these features effectively in your projects.

## Classes

### Defining a Class

ES6 classes introduce a new syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance. Here is a basic example:

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

const person = new Person(Alice, 30);
person.greet();  // Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
