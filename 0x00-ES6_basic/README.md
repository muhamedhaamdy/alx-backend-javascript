## What is ES6

ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript language specification. It introduced many new features to make JavaScript more powerful and easier to write.

## New Features Introduced in ES6

ES6 introduced several new features, including:

- Arrow Functions
- Classes
- Template Literals
- Destructuring Assignment
- Modules
- Promises
- `let` and `const`
- Default Parameters

## The Difference Between a Constant and a Variable

### Variable (`let`)

Variables declared with `let` can be reassigned and have block scope.

```javascript
let age = 25;
age = 26; // This is allowed
